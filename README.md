#Senior Design Project


6/4/18 (MT)

Added a pyton file called bluetooth0. Basically playing around with the HC-05
and trying to send one signal at a time. 


6/3/18 (MT)

Thought we could use this as an update log? Let me know what you guys think.
Just add descriptions of whatever file you have added/changed. Make sure you
add your updates to the TOP of the log so the most latest changes are up there.
